When browsing through my personal folders to delete files, I decided that I wanted to try and recreate an application that could do the same. This file remover was
made with C# and Windows Forms as the UI. Users are able to select specfic folder paths and choose files within the directory, the files are then places into a queue
and when the Delete button is pressed the app runs through the queue and deletes all files.
